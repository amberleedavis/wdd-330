        <h2>HTML & CSS</h2>
        <p> Transforms and transitions are really fun to work with in CSS. Transforms help you take and object and transform it through animation,
            and transitions help move an object on the page. You can get really creative with this! Transitions and transforms also help with creating
            a smooth and natural feel to the user interface. I also think SVGs are cool, but I don't really like creating my own shapes in HTML. It can 
            get pretty complicated. I prefer creating my objects in Illustrator.
