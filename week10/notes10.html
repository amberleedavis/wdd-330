        <h2>Form Validation</h2>
        <p> HTML forms are really handy when you need to collect information about the user. For example, forms can be used for birthdays,
            phone numbers, names, and emails, to name a few. Lots of websites use HTML forms. Login info is also an example of forms. Form Validation,
            however, helps users to be specific in format and accuracy. Form validation will make the user go back to a form if something isn't entered correctly.
            Common form validations are, "please provide your phone number in this format: (xxx) xxx-xxxx", "this field is required" or "invalid email given".
            Form validations help the user and the developer.
