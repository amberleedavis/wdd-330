        <h2>JavaScript - Debugging</h2>
        <p> Debugging is an extremely useful tool in JavaScript. I use it all the time when something in my code isn't working properly.
            The more you use it, the more familiar you will become with it's tools. The first thing I do is check for any errors. After that,
            I'll check the lines of code the errors are coming from, and if I still can't figure it out I go to the debugger in the inspection tool.
            This way, I can watch my code execute each line until I see where I may have messed up.
