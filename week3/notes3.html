        <h2>JavaScript - This</h2>
        <p> "This" in JavaScript can be confusing when first learning about it, but I'm starting to see how important it is
            to know how to use it in my code. "This" will take any object you have listed under your variable and display it
            accordingly. It's as simple as that! Here is an example of that:
        </p>

        <code>
                let person = {
                    name: Amber;
                    lastName: Davis;
                    age: 22;
                    location: Rexburg;
                }
    
                hello(){
                    console.log("hello " + this.name + " " + this.lastName);
                }
    
                person.hello();
                </code>
                    
        <p>
           From the reading, it states that if you were to use person.name or person.lastName, you could get the same result, but if you
        were to use person again somewhere else in your code, you could be outputting the wrong information. That's why "this" comes in handy.
        It identifies the variable it is inside of and outputs only that information you're targeting.
        </p>
