        <h2>APIs</h2>
        <p> API's are very helpful when you need to store a lot of data and use on multiple sites and projects. APIs can be used for simple applications,
            such as generating random lists, to pulling the information to specific parts of a site. If you google "Fun APIs", you are sure to find 
            something that you could build a small project with. API's usually store a lot of information about each item listed. For example, if I were
            to create an API of my family, I could list names, date of birth, birth location, current city, occupation, etc. Doing so will help developers access
            any data they may need.
