        <h2>JavaScript - Forms</h2>
        <p> I'm so excited to be reading about something that I have a little more knowledge on. I've worked on forms in
            CIT 230 as well
            as other past classes so I feel more comfortable with the subject. A form is basically something you fill
            out on a website. This can
            include filling out any login information, search boxes, comment boxes, phone numbers, or even drop down
            menus. Forms are created in HTML and then
            linked to a JavaScript file to give each form a purpose. To create forms, you use input fields, buttons, and
            select menus in the HTML. Here is an example of creating a search form in HTML and JavaScript:
        </p>

        <code>
            <form name="myForm" action="/action_page.php" onsubmit="return validateForm()" method="post">
                Name: <input type="text" name="fname">
                <input type="submit" value="Submit">
            </form>

            <script>
                function validateForm() {
                    var x = document.forms["myForm"]["fname"].value;
                    if (x == "") {
                        alert("Name must be filled out");
                        return false;
                    }
                }
            </script>
        </code>

        <p>
           I found this example on W3 Schools. It's a simple text input. The JavaScript has an if statement, and it basically says "if x 
           (the form) isn't filled out, alert the user that a name must be flled out". 
        </p>
