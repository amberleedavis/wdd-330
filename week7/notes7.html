        <h1>Week 07 Notes</h1>
        <h2>JavaScript - Functions</h2>
        <p> Functions are reusable and versatile, and that's one reason why JavaScript is a favorite language to many developers. There are
            also different types of functions, such as async, recursive, functions that return functions, etc. A function type I found really interesting
            is the recursive function. This function calls itself until it doesn't. To me, it's similar to a loop but used as a function. The recursive function
            will call itself over and over again, so it's important that in your code you have a stopping point.
        </p>

        <p>Here's an example I found of a countdown created for New Years Eve using a recursive function:</p>

        <code>
                let countDown = function f(fromNumber) {
                    console.log(fromNumber);
                
                    let nextNumber = fromNumber - 1;
                
                    if (nextNumber > 0) {
                        f(nextNumber);
                    }
                }
                
                let newYearCountDown = countDown;
                countDown = null;
                newYearCountDown(10);
        </code>
