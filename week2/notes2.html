        <h1>Week 02 Notes</h1>
        <h2>JavaScript Basics- Loops</h2>
        <p> Loops are something that I have a hard time understanding. While taking CIT 160, I felt very lost and the
            concept never really clicked.
            Every time I tried to create a loop it rarely worked out. Since it's a concept I have the most trouble with,
            I thought I should start learning
            more about it!
        </p>
        <p>
            From what I understand, there are three types of loops: for, while, and do while. There are also infinite
            loops but those aren't necessarily good
            (infinite loops can crash your program).
            The purpose of a loop is to repeat code under certain conditions. When the conditions are met, the loop
            stops. The example I'm going to show is a for loop.

        <p>Here is the example of code I created on my own, along with a demo.</p>
        <br>
        
        <code>
            function fun(){
            
            let text = " ";

            for(let i = 0; i < 5; i++){ 
                text += "JavaScript is Fun!" + "<br>" ; }
                document.getElementById('fun').innerHTML=text; } </code> 
                
         <p>With this code, the saying "JavaScript is Fun!" should repeat 5 times. Click the button to check it out.</p>

                <p>
                    <div id="fun"></div>
                </p>
    </section>

    <button onclick='fun()'>Display</button>

    <script src="js/loop.js"></script>
