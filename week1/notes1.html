    <h2>Local Storage</h2>
    <p>
        While reading "Doing Stuff with Web Things", I'm learning about local storage.
        I honestly have never heard of the term "local storage" before, or maybe I have and I 
        don't remember. From what I understand, local storage helps pair things together.
        In the story editor example, the story tself (storyHTML) should be labeled the actual
        name the story (storyName). Essentally, key value pairs are stored are saved in a web browser.
    </p>

    <p>
        After doing my own research in w3schools, I also found out that local storage has no expiraton date,
        and the data will not be deleted when the browser is closed. It can be accessed at any time, but it will be
        read-only. This will be handy with applications. In the reading it mentions that no one would want to use an
        app that can't remember what you did the last time you visited.

    <p>Here is the example of code I created following along with the book. There was also HTML and CSS, but the JavaScript
        was the main focus of the lesson.
    </p>
    <code>
            function loadStory(){
                var storyName = document.getElementById('name_input').value
                var storyHTML = localStorage.getItem(storyName)
                document.getElementById('story_editor').value = storyHTML
            
            }
            <br/>
            function saveStory(){
                var storyName = document.getElementById('name_input').value
                var storyHTML = document.getElementById('story_editor').value
                localStorage.setItem(storyName, storyHTML)
            }
            <br/>
            function displayStory(){
                var storyHTML = document.getElementById('story_editor').value
                document.getElementById('story_display').innerHTML = storyHTML
                
            }
    </code>
